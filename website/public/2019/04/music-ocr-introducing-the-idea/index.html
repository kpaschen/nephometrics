    <h2>Music OCR: introducing the idea</h2>

    

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.nephometrics.ch/2019/04/music-ocr-introducing-the-idea/">Published April 10, 2019</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <p>Sometimes I write my own music. I play the piano (badly), and I&rsquo;ll
never be a great composer, but I find it interesting to play around
with melody and chords.</p>

<p>I write notes by hand on paper, and whenever I feel like I&rsquo;ve got
something together, I typeset it using <a href="http://www.lilypond.org/">lilypond</a>.
That&rsquo;s a markup format / programming environment for typesetting musical
scores, similar in spirit to <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>
(though LaTeX actually has its own music support via MusicTeX).</p>

<p>My process is clearly a little laborious. Lilypond is pretty cool in terms
of the quality of typesetting as well as flexibility and programmability, but
it is very much not a wysiwyg environment. I believe people who are more
seriously into writing scores use software like
 <a href="https://www.sibelius.com/">Sibelius</a>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I rather like developing music with pencil and paper. And wouldn&rsquo;t it
be cool if I could take a picture of my handwritten notes on my phone and
have a computer read them and generate a typeset file (and even a midi file)
for me? So I set to work on that.</p>

<p>I know there are other people working on this. For example, there&rsquo;s a data set
of handwritten music symbols called <a href="https://grfia.dlsi.ua.es/homus/">HOMUS</a>
and other related work. It&rsquo;s obviously not a huge research topic, but work
has been done in this space. However, I&rsquo;m not trying to compete with university
researchers; I just want to write some code, learn a few things, see how far I
get.</p>

<p>For illustration, here&rsquo;s a picture of some handwritten notes, taken with my phone:</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/sample-raw-notes.png" alt="Handwriting sample" /></p>

<p>And here is the same composition typeset with Lilypond (this was done manually,
hence the differences in spelling, articulation, etc).</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/sample-set-notes.png" alt="Typeset sample" /></p>

<p>The title is from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9oG_IG62_c">experimental short film</a> by Maya Deren which (from what I can tell) seems to be a popular
composition assignment.</p>

<p>I do have a background in programming, but I&rsquo;m really not a computer vision
expert, nor do I know much about writing software for mobile phones. For a first
stab, I just took a look at <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> and decided I&rsquo;d try
to run it on my phone. OpenCV has Android support via JNI. So
I went ahead and installed Android Studio with OpenCV and got to work. This was fun
and I had some encouraging early results, but it also drew pretty heavily on the
battery. So much so that my battery became convex (you do not want your battery
to become convex) and I had to replace it. Luckily, this was an older phone,
the battery was easy to replace, and I decided to call this a learning experience.</p>

<p>The nice thing about running the entire system on the phone is that it could
work offline. You wouldn&rsquo;t need an internet connection, and you could keep all
your data on your phone. However, you&rsquo;re
unlikely to be stuck somewhere with only your phone,
some awesome sheet music, and an urgent desire to typeset said sheet music, but
absolutely no internet access. Thus it seems like I could run
the core processing server-side. This means I have to run a server somewhere,
but that&rsquo;s actually something I know how to do (as opposed to image recognition,
mobile software, or indeed composing).</p>

<p>Now the phone app will be just a thin client. It takes the picture and uploads
it to a server. The server processes the image and writes a lilypond file.
The server then calls lilypond to generate both pdf and midi output files.
This can be done by having the server execute a shell command, possibly via
an API provider deployed separately (that seems to be what <a href="https://github.com/GGracieux/lilypond-api">this code</a> does); or I suppose I could look at the
Lilypond source code to see how hard it would be to interact with it
via library calls. At that point, I&rsquo;d have to
think about licensing implications because Lilypond is GNU, but
I don&rsquo;t mind putting my own code under a GNU license.</p>

<p>I want the server to provide a notification back to the client when the
file is ready to view and play. I might be able to do this near-interactively,
but (especially if I call lilypond via a shell command, and taking into account
the network delay for transmitting the image to the server and sending the
 pdf and midi files back), latency could be on the order of seconds.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll set the server up so it does not store the images after processing. This is
both because storage is expensive and because I don&rsquo;t want to hang on to
my customers&rsquo; data. Since I don&rsquo;t require login credentials or payment details,
 the security risks seem manageable.</p>

<p>Running the core processing server-side has several advantages: most updates
will affect only the server code (much easier than updating a bunch of mobile
clients), and I can take advantage of machine-learning models that would be
too large to fit onto a phone. Plus I get to use OpenCV in C++ rather than
via JNI on Android; C++ is certainly not my most productive language, but it is
where you find the best documentation and examples for OpenCV.</p>

<p>As far as overall architecture goes, this should be it. I don&rsquo;t expect the app
to become so popular that I&rsquo;d have to worry about the max number of concurrent
requests I can handle; if that ever does happen, first I&rsquo;ll celebrate my
success, and then I&rsquo;ll deal with the problem (but I doubt it will happen).</p>

<p>The sample photo I included above demonstrates a lot of what makes this problem
hard: the picture is unevenly lit, skewed and warped, it has poor contrast and
it has extraneous items (e.g. the punch holes on the left side). The handwriting is
poorly formed, the bar lines are not straight, note heads and necks don&rsquo;t always
connect, there&rsquo;s crossed-out notes, and there&rsquo;s handwritten words between the
lines. In the following posts, I&rsquo;ll write about the options I&rsquo;ve found for dealing
with these issues; I don&rsquo;t think I can solve all of them perfectly though, so
some of the upcoming decisions are about the user experience when the system
cannot quite decide how to interpret your handwriting.</p>
