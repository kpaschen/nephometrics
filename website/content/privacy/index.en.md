My website is generated statically using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and
sets no cookies. I do not use social media integrations and have not enabled
ads. There is no need for me to collect personal data, so I don't.

### Hosting Provider
Hosting Providers typically collect information regarding page visits
 in server logfiles.

That information as well as this entire website are stored with my
hosting provider

whose privacy statement you can find [here](https://www.metanet.ch/about_metanet/rechtliches).

### YouTube
I can include YouTube videos in my pages. This will cause a visit to my page
to create a connection to a YouTube server telling YouTube which of my pages
was visited. If you're logged in to your Google account while visiting that
page, your user ID will also be transmitted to YouTube. You can avoid this
by logging out of your Google account.
