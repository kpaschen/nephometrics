I am based in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm open to remote work or to working on-site within the Zurich and Winterthur
areas.

If you'd like to hire me, we can negotiate an hourly or daily rate, or a fixed-price contract.

If you have a project that I could contribute to, please get in touch:

<hr />

I am a software engineer with significant SRE/DevOps experience. I like to help
people create maintainable, resilient, scalable systems.

My SRE experience comes from many years at Google and some more recent client projects;
confidentiality prevents me from publishing work many samples. However, if you browse
[my github repositories](https://github.com/kpaschen) or [my blog](blog), you can see some
code samples.
