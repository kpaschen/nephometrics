I'm going to write a little about my experiences developing software.

I've been keeping an informal 'scrap book' for a long time, where I record
commandlines I've tried, paste links to interesting things I've found,
summarise what I've learned. This comes in handy occasionally when I need to
reconstruct what exactly I did to make something work or why I decided to write
my code in a particular way.

Maybe a blog will provide more structure to those notes and make them more
searchable? Who knows, maybe someone besides myself will stumble across my notes,
too. For now, I haven't enabled comments or visitor tracking, mainly because
I don't want to spend time dealing with the privacy and moderation requirements.
